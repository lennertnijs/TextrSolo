the cursor is buffer editor/view specific -> add it to the bufferEditor.
insert/remove can pass this index, and return the new result

adding the filebuffer instead of text into actions will make it so you can pass all the work through insert/remove() in
filebuffer, thus making the text update calls to the listeners easy peasy
